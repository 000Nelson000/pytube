TODO
====

* Refactor filename out of ``Video`` class, allowing for graceful file
  renaming. At present, the filename must be set before defining the url.
* Better handling and/or conditionally raising exceptions.
* Add setup.py.
* Detect duplicate video encoding options, preventing the creation of identical
    video class instances. (can cause get() method to raise unnecessary
    multiple returned excepion).
* Add functionality for batch URL processing.
* Scrape and inject additional video information into metadata.
